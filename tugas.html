    <h1>Diamond Beach</h1>
    <p>
      Diamond Beach on Nusa Penida is one of the most fascinating beaches in
      Indonesia. Together with Kelingking Beach, it’s a must-visit destination
      when traveling to Bali. The beach boasts mind-bending turquoise waters,
      majestic cliffs, diamond-shaped limestones, and palms. The views are like
      those on a postcard. We were stunned by its unusual beauty when we got our
      first glimpse.
